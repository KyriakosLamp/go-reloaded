# TASK-01 Implementation Report

## TASK-01 Implementation Summary

✅ **Goal Achieved**: Initialize the Go module, directories, and test framework.

### Created Files:
1. **go.mod** - Go module initialization
2. **utils.go** - File I/O utilities (`ReadFile`, `WriteFile`)
3. **utils_test.go** - `TestFileIO` test function
4. **main.go** - Basic project entry point

### Validation Results:
- ✅ `go test` passes successfully
- ✅ Project builds without errors
- ✅ File read/write functionality verified

The implementation is minimal and focused, providing exactly what's needed for the file I/O foundation that the pipeline will use in subsequent tasks.
