# AI AGENT INTRUCTIONS

## library
- *analysis*        /docs/Code_Analysis.md    is the analysis of the project   
- *general steps*   /docs/go-reloaded_StagesPlan.md   is the full plan step by step for the project
- *individual tasks* /tasks/   this folder contains each task/step  (first task is TASK-01-xxx.md , last is TASK-13-xxx.md)
- *test cases* /docs/Test_Cases.md contains test cases for the project
- *agent log* /docs/Agent_Log.md this is your log-diary write if you want there what you have done and what goes on but dont spend too much effort , it is not mandatory
- *functions folder* /functions/ the rest of the fuctions that the main and other files will live here in order to keep it clean

## Individual tasks explanation
- Each task containt the title with and small brief at the very top explaining whats the main focus.
- The "completed:" section  will be marked by you when you complete the task
- The GOAL is what needed to be achieved.
- Test writing is a small piece of testing that the code has to produce.
- Implemetation describes most of the times the way the goal has to be done, try following the implemetation but feel free to add your own implemetation if more are needed to achieve the goal.
- Validation  works with the Test Writing after the code is created in order to test it.

## Agent rules
- The goals and rules of the project are writen, do not interfere with the rules, tasks or analysis.
- You can write in the *agent log* whenever you want in the context of the project
- You will be asked to markdown completed tasks in the specific 'completed:' section ( usually second row of each task), just fill in a check ( ✅ ) no need for timestaps and dates
- All the secondary functions used in main.go should be create in the *functions folder*
- Feel free to run commands fon the cli in order to test, create or update functions
- Comply with goals and behaviors bellow

## Goals and Behavior
- Each time you are called i will specify what *individual task* i want you to build, if i dont then ask me.
- I want you to proceed with each *individualy task* but keep in mind the *general steps* in order to avoid backtracking.
- provide questions if the information from *individual tasks* are not enough in order to create the code for the goal.
- After creating the code i will review it and make sure everything works out. I will either tell you what to fix or tell you that the task is complete so you can mark the task as completed.
- After successfully completing each task, create a "Task-XX-report.md" file in the "agent_reports" folder with the implementation summary, validation results, and key technical decisions
